# Immutable Base Project Template

Welcome to the Immutable Base Project Template! This template serves as a foundation for building web applications with modern technologies, including Vite, SvelteKit, Immutable SDK, and essential Web3 polyfills.

## Getting Started

To start using this template, you can just clone this repository and go from there.


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## IMPORTANT NOTE:
This is not meant for production use but simply to demonstrate the capabilities of Immutable SDK in as little steps as possible.
